My name\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Nicolas, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m an Editor here at Genius. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been working on lyric sites for over a decade now. I was an administrator on LyricWiki for about 7 years before it was shut down in 2019, and am currently a moderator on LetsSingIt. I initially joined Genius in 2014 just to help spread lyrics I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d transcribed, though after LyricWiki\\xe2\\x80\\x99s closure, it quickly became my new mainstay for lyrics and music in general.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you need help with something or need me to explain an edit I made, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hesitate to shoot me a message! I have a huge passion for lyric sites and am always happy to help out. However, please be specific \\xe2\\x80\\x93 vague messages like \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhy was my annotation rejected?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give me any information and may be ignored.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThat is not me in my avatar, by the way \\xe2\\x80\\x93 rather, it is a silly screencap of musician Jay Ferguson.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "WICKHAM.\n",

      "Elizabeth, as you can see, we are very different men, and he hates me.\n",

      "that it has required the utmost force of passion on my part to put them\n",
      "aside. But, my dear Miss Bennet, your triumph is complete. Your own\n",
      "loveliness stands out the fairer in its contrast to your surroundings,\n",

      "Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was decided. Your\n",
      "character was unfolded in the recital which I received months ago from\n",
